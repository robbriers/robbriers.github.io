Eurasian otter Lutra lutra resting sites are strictly protected by UK and European legislation and are ostensibly identified from associated field-signs. This legislation is difficult to apply given the poor understanding of resting sites coupled with the lack of evidence supporting a field-sign signature. We aimed to use camera-trap data to identify resting sites, investigate whether field-signs differed between resting and non-resting sites and describe behaviours recorded on camera-traps that are associated with resting. An evidence-based approach to identifying resting sites of Eurasian otter Lutra lutra from camera-trap and field-sign data camera-trap data showed that otters frequently visited potential resting sites, characterised by a very short time within the structure (often \u003c 4 min). Resting sites were characterised by longer durations (often hours) during the daytime and night-time. Based on these data, six of our 26 sites were identified as resting sites. Modelling suggested that no single field-sign had a clear association with resting sites. However, we found a hitherto unrecognised distinction between otter latrines (defecation sites) and spraint (scent-marking) sites, and that camera-trap observations of latrine behaviour and bedding collection were exclusive to resting sites. As bedding and latrines are not always visible, presence of either indicates a resting site but no interpretation can be drawn from their absence, so camera-trapping would be recommended to identify resting site status. Data simulations found that camera-trapping for 38 d in winter, followed by 38 d in spring, was the optimal approach for a 95% chance of detecting a rest across all resting sites. Ours is the first study to identify standards and expectations for surveys using camera-trap and field-signs at Eurasian otter resting sites. Our novel account of their resting activity facilitates better interpretation of legislation.","tags":null,"title":"An evidence-based approach to identifying resting sites of Eurasian otter Lutra lutra from camera-trap and field-sign data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Stenton, CA","Bolger, EL","Michenot, M","Dodd, JA","Wale, MA","Rob Briers","Hartl, MGJ","Diele, K"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1654041600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1654041600,"objectID":"635ffb9f3ec9cac77f02687dbdec93f0","permalink":"https://robbriers.github.io/publication/neph_noise/","publishdate":"2022-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/neph_noise/","section":"publication","summary":"There is an urgent need to understand how organisms respond to multiple, potentially interacting drivers in today's world.

Ponds also provide important contributions to society through the provision of ecosystem services. Despite the ecological and societal importance of ponds, freshwater research, policy, and conservation have historically focused on larger water bodies, with significant gaps remaining in our understanding and conservation of pond ecosystems. In May 2019, pond researchers and practitioners participated in a workshop to tackle several pond ecology, conservation, and management issues. Nine research themes and 30 research questions were identified during and following the workshop to address knowledge gaps around: (1) pond habitat definition; (2) global and long-term data availability; (3) anthropogenic stressors; (4) aquatic-terrestrial interactions; (5) succession and disturbance; (6) freshwater connectivity; (7) pond monitoring and technological advances; (8) socio-economic factors; and (9) conservation, management, and policy. Key areas for the future inclusion of ponds in environmental and conservation policy were also discussed. Addressing gaps in our fundamental understanding of pond ecosystems will facilitate more effective research-led conservation and management of pondscapes, their inclusion in environmental policy, support the sustainability of ecosystem services, and help address many of the global threats driving the decline in freshwater biodiversity.","tags":null,"title":"Pond ecology and conservation: research priorities and knowledge gaps","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Schweinsberg M","Feldman M","Staub N","van den Akker OR","van Aert RCM","van Assen MALM","Liu Y","Althoff T","Heer J","Kale A","Mohamed Z","Amireh H","Prasad VV","Bernstein A","Robinson E","Snellman K","Sommer SA","Otner SMG","Robinson D","Madan N","Silberzahn R","Goldstein P","Tierney W","Murase T","Mandl B","Viganola D","Strobl C","Schaumans CBC","Kelchtermans S","Naseeb C","Garrison SM","Yarkoni T","Chan CSR","Adie P","Alaburda P","Albers C","Alspaugh S","Alstott J","Nelson AA","de la Rubia EA","Arzi A","Bahnik S","Baik J","Balling LW","Banker S","Baranger DA","Barr DJ","Barros-Rivera B","Bauer M","Blaise E","Boelen L","Carbonell KB","Rob Briers","Burkhard O","Canela MA","Castrillo L","Catlett T","Chen OL","Clark M","Cohn B","Coppock A","Cuguero-Escofet N","Curran PG","Cyrus-Lai W","Dai D","Dalla Riva GV","Danielsson H","Russo RDSM","de Silva N","Derungs C","Dondelinger F","de Souza CD","Dube BT","Dubova M","Dunn B","Edelsbrunner PA","Finley S","Fox N","Gnambs T","Gong YY","Grand E","Greenawalt B","Han D","Hanel PHP","Hong AB","Hood D","Hsueh J","Huang LL","Hui KN","Hultman KA","Javaid A","Jiang LJ","Jong J","Kamdar J","Kane D","Kappler G","Kaszubowski E","Kavanagh CM","Khabsa M","Kleinberg B","Kouros J","Krause H","Krypotos AM","Lavbic D","Lee RL","Leffel T","Lim WY","Liverani S","Loh B","Lonsmann D","Low JW","Lu A","MacDonald K","Madan CR","Madsen LH","Maimone C","Mangold A","Marshall A","Matskewich HE","Mavon K","McLain KL","McNamara AA","McNeill M","Mertens U","Miller D","Moore B","Moore A","Nantz E","Nasrullah Z","Nejkovic V","Nell CS","Nelson AA","Nilsonne G","Nolan R","O'Brien CE","O'Neil P","O'Shea K","Olita T","Otterbacher J","Palsetia D","Pereira B","Pozdniakov I","Protzko J","Reyt JN","Riddle T","Ali ARO","Ropovik I","Rosenberg JM","Rothen S","Schulte-Mecklenbeck M","Sharma N","Shotwell G","Skarzynski M","Stedden W","Stodden V","Stoffel MA","Stoltzman S","Subbaiah S","Tatman R","Thibodeau PH","Tomkins S","Valdivia A","van de Woestijne GDB","Viana L","Villeseche F","Wadsworth WD","Wanders F","Watts K","Wells JD","Whelpley CE","Won A","Wu L","Yip A","Youngflesh C","Yu JC","Zandian A","Zhang LL","Zibman C","Uhlmann EL"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1625097600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1625097600,"objectID":"ec0f86b8e3f32780f4fe8fb522c0ec3a","permalink":"https://robbriers.github.io/publication/same_data/","publishdate":"2021-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/same_data/","section":"publication","summary":"In this crowdsourced initiative, independent analysts used the same dataset to test two hypotheses regarding the effects of scientists' gender and professional status on verbosity during group meetings.

Here, we investigated the population's genetic diversity using mitochondrial DNA (D-loop 186 bp and cytochrome b 487 bp). We found that the Nubian ibex in the southern region of Oman was more diverse (D-loop HD; 0.838) compared with the central region (0.511) and gene flow between them was restricted. We compared the genetic profiles of wild Nubian ibex from Oman with captive ibex. A Bayesian phylogenetic tree showed that wild Nubian ibex form a distinct clade independent from captive animals. This divergence was supported by high mean distances (D-loop 0.126, cytochrome b 0.0528) and high F-ST statistics (D-loop 0.725, cytochrome b 0.968). These results indicate that captive ibex are highly unlikely to have originated from the wild population in Oman and the considerable divergence suggests that the wild population in Oman should be treated as a distinct taxonomic unit.

Local contribution to beta diversity (LCBD) identifies individual habitats that make a significant contribution to beta diversity and may have important practical implications, particularly for conservation of habitat networks. In this study, we develop and apply a conservation prioritization approach based on LCBD in aquatic invertebrate communities from 132 ponds. Location Five urban settlements in the UK: Halton, Loughborough, Stockport, Birmingham and Huddersfield. Methods We partition LCBD into richness difference (nestedness: RichDiffLCBD) and species replacement (turnover: ReplLCBD) and identify key environmental variables driving LCBD. We examine LCBD at two scales relevant to conservation planning: within urban settlements and nationally across the UK. Results Significant differences in LCBD values were recorded among the five settlements. In four of the five urban settlements studied, pond sites with the greatest LCBD values typically showed high replacement values. Significant LCBD sites and sites with high taxonomic diversity together supported more of the regional species pool (70%-97%) than sites with high taxonomic diversity alone (54%-94%) or what could be protected by the random selection of sites. LCBD was significantly associated with vegetation shading, surface area, altitude and macrophyte cover. Main conclusions Conservation prioritization that incorporates LCBD and sites with high taxonomic diversity improves the effectiveness of conservation actions within pond habitat networks, ensures sites supporting high biodiversity are protected and provides a method to define a spatial network of protected sites. Identifying new, effective conservation approaches, particularly in urban areas where resources may be scarce and conflicts regarding land use exist, is essential to ensure biodiversity is fully supported, and detrimental anthropogenic effects are reduced.","tags":null,"title":"Local contributions to beta diversity in urban pond networks: Implications for biodiversity conservation and management","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Thornton MJ","Mitchell C","Griffin LR","Rob Briers","Minshull B","Maciver A","White PJC"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1617408000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1617408000,"objectID":"b1d2098aef00bcff92c60e3acab36a89","permalink":"https://robbriers.github.io/publication/bean_geese/","publishdate":"2021-04-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/bean_geese/","section":"publication","summary":"Our multi-scale habitat selection and spatial analysis of a threatened population of Taiga Bean Geese Anser fabalis highlights the importance of monitoring and review programmes to determine whether species conservation measures are being implemented at the correct spatio-temporal scales.

Methods A five-year field count dataset was used to quantify foraging habitat selection at the population range scale. In addition, global positioning system (GPS)/ultra high frequency loggers were attached to 12 birds and GPS location data were collected to quantify foraging habitat selection at an individual foraging range scale. Results Generalized linear models predicted that, at the population foraging range scale, Taiga Bean Geese selected agriculturally improved pasture, and this selection was more pronounced at greater distances from public roads. At an individual foraging range scale, compositional analysis revealed that agriculturally improved pasture was significantly selected over all other habitats. There was a substantial mismatch between their individual foraging ranges and the protected area, with less than 35% (median: 21%; range 9.5-31.9%) of their individual full foraging ranges overlapping with the protected area.

The genetic identity of the Scottish populations has not been established. There is also debate about the status of the European bullhead and its validity as single species, a species complex with several unresolved species, or distinct different species in its European distribution range. There is therefore a need to determine the taxonomy and likely source of the novel Scottish populations. Genetic analyses using cytochrome oxidase 1 (COI) mitochondrial DNA sequences were undertaken on specimens from the Forth and Clyde catchments, and combined with the results of morphological characteristics to provide a comprehensive assessment of the taxonomic classification for Scottish bullheads. There was considerable variation in morphological characteristics between populations within Scotland and a wider range of variability than previously recorded for English populations. Genetically the Scottish populations were very closely related to English specimens, supporting the hypothesis of introduction directly from England to Scotland. In terms of broader relationships, Scottish specimens are genetically more closely related to the ostensible species Chabot fluviatile Cottus perifretum, which has been suggested as one of a complex of species across Europe.

Despite evidence suggesting that increasing A. simplex (s.s.) intensity is a causative factor in RVS aetiology, the definitive cause remains unclear. Methods: A total of 117 Atlantic salmon were sampled from commercial fisheries on the East, West, and North coasts of Scotland and examined for ascaridoid parasites. Genetic identification of a subsample of Anisakis larvae was performed using the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of ribosomal DNA. To assess the extent of differentiation of feeding grounds and dietary composition, stable isotope analysis of carbon and nitrogen was carried out on Atlantic salmon muscle tissue. Results: In the present study, the obtained ITS rDNA sequences matched A. simplex (s.s.) sequences deposited in GenBank at 99-100%. Not all isolated larvae (n=30,406) were genetically identified. Therefore, the morphotype found in this study is referred to as A. simplex (sensu lato). Anisakis simplex (s.l.) was the most prevalent (100%) nematode with the highest mean intensity (259.9 +/- 197.3), in comparison to Hysterothylacium aduncum (66.7%, 6.4 +/- 10.2) and Pseudoterranova decipiens (s.l.) (14.5%, 1.4 +/- 0.6). The mean intensity of A. simplex (s.l.) represents a four-fold increase compared to published data (63.6 +/- 31.9) from salmon captured in Scotland in 2009. Significant positive correlations between A. simplex (s.l.) larvae intensities from the body and the vent suggest that they play a role in the emergence of RVS. The lack of a significant variation in stable isotope ratios of Atlantic salmon indicates that diet or feeding ground are not driving regional differences in A. simplex (s.l.) intensities. Conclusions: This paper presents the most recent survey for ascaridoid parasites of wild Atlantic salmon from three coastal regions in Scotland. A significant rise in A. simplex (s.l.) intensity could potentially increase both natural mortality rates of Atlantic salmon and possible risks for salmon consumers due to the known zoonotic role of A. simplex (s.s.) and A. pegreffii within the A. simplex (s.l.) species complex.","tags":null,"title":"Increasing intensities of Anisakis simplex third-stage larvae (L3) in Atlantic salmon of coastal waters of Scotland","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Wale MA","Rob Briers","Hartl MGJ","Bryson D","Diele K"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1572566400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1572566400,"objectID":"3408e4fcd310060a545e67a3223ce302","permalink":"https://robbriers.github.io/publication/stoten2019/","publishdate":"2019-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/stoten2019/","section":"publication","summary":"Responses of marine invertebrates to anthropogenic noise are insufficiently known, impeding our understanding of ecosystemic impacts of noise and the development of mitigation strategies. We show that the blue mussel, Mytilus edulis, is negatively affected by ship-noise playbacks across different levels of biological organization. We take a novel mechanistic multi-method approach testing and employing established ecotoxicological techniques (i.e. Comet Assay and oxidative stress tests) in combination with behavioral and physiological biomarkers. We evidence, for the first time in marine species, noise-induced changes in DNA integrity (six-fold higher DNA single strand-breaks in haemocytes and gill epithelial cells) and oxidative stress (68% increased TBARS in gill cells). We further identify physiological and behavioral changes (12% reduced oxygen consumption, 60% increase in valve gape, 84% reduced filtration rate) in noise-exposed mussels. By employing established ecotoxicological techniques we highlight impacts not only on the organismal level, but also on ecological performance. When investigating species that produce little visually obvious responses to anthropogenic noise, the above mentioned endpoints are key to revealing sublethal effects of noise and thus enable a better understanding of how this emerging, but often overlooked stressor, affects animals without complex behaviors. Our integrated approach to noise research can be used as a model for other invertebrate species and faunal groups, and inform the development of effective methods for assessing and monitoring noise impacts. Given the observed negative effects, noise should be considered a potential confounding factor in studies involving other stressors.","tags":null,"title":"From DNA to ecological performance: Effects of anthropogenic noise on a reef-building mussel","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Culhane F","Rob Briers","Tett P","Fernandes TF"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1572220800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1572220800,"objectID":"8d63d6e6c1bdf8ad7cd77d97ca99660f","permalink":"https://robbriers.github.io/publication/jmba2019/","publishdate":"2019-10-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jmba2019/","section":"publication","summary":"Nutrient enrichment is a significant cause of ecosystem change in coastal habitats worldwide. This study focuses on the change in a benthic macroinvertebrate community and environmental quality as assessed through different biotic indices following the construction of a sewage outfall pipe in the west of Scotland, from first implementation to seven years after operation of the pipe. Benthic macroinvertebrates are an important part of marine ecosystems because they mediate ecosystem processes and functions, are a key part of food webs and they provide many ecosystem services. Results indicated a clear change in benthic communities over time with an increase in species richness and changes to benthic community composition (specifically feeding type, bioturbation mode and ecological group) towards those indicative of organic enrichment. No clear spatial zonation was observed because organic carbon content increased over the entire area. According to a suite of benthic indices calculated, some negative changes were detectable following the start of sewage disposal, but largely negative community changes, and a change from 'good' to 'moderate' quality, only occurred seven years after implementation. The increase in species richness in response to increasing disturbance reduced the utility of a multi-metric index, the Infaunal Quality Index, which, instead of amplifying the signal of negative impact, dampened it. We suggest that any change in communities, regardless of direction, should be heeded, and species richness is a particularly sensitive and early warning indicator for this, but a suite of approaches is required to understand benthic community changes","tags":null,"title":"Response of a marine benthic invertebrate community and biotic indices to organic enrichment from sewage disposal","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rob Briers"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1562198400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1562198400,"objectID":"2738c1f357ec6e3889b74e81d8938a52","permalink":"https://robbriers.github.io/publication/joss2019/","publishdate":"2019-07-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/joss2019/","section":"publication","summary":" ","tags":null,"title":"cde - R package to retrieve data from the Environment Agency Catchment Data Explorer site","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"I am interested in carbon stores and flows within aquatic systems.

Freshwater ecosystems are found throughout agricultural and urban landscapes and provide a wide range of ecosystem services, but globally they are also amongst the most vulnerable. In particular, ponds (lentic waters typically less than 2 ha), provide natural flood management, sequester carbon and hold significant cultural value. However, to inform their management it is important to understand (1) how functional diversity varies in response to disturbance and (2) the link between biodiversity conservation and ecosystem function. In this study, a meta-analysis of seven separate pond studies from across England and Wales was carried out to explore the effect of urban and agricultural land-use gradients, shading, emergent vegetation, surface area and pH upon groups of functionally similar members of the macroinvertebrate fauna. Functional effect groups were first identified by carrying out a hierarchical cluster analysis using body size, voltinism and feeding habits (18 categories) that are closely related to biogeochemical processes (e.g. nutrient and carbon recycling). Secondly, the influence of the gradients upon effect group membership (functional redundancy - FR) and the breadth of traits available to aid ecosystem recovery (response diversity) was assessed using species counts and functional dispersion (FDis) using 12 response traits. The effect of land-use gradients was unpredictable, whilst there was a negative response in both FR and FDis to shading and positive responses to increases in emergent vegetation cover and surface area. An inconsistent association between FDis and FR suggested that arguments for taxonomic biodiversity conservation to augment ecosystem functioning are too simplistic. Thus, a deeper understanding of the response of functional diversity to disturbance could have greater impact with decision-makers who may relate better to the loss of ecosystem function in response to environmental degradation than species loss alone.","tags":null,"title":"The functional response and resilience in small waterbodies along land-use and environmental gradients","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hill MJ","Biggs J","Thornhill I","Rob Briers","Ledger M","Gledhill DJ","Wood PJ","Hassall C"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1516147200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1516147200,"objectID":"bda34e10def4b9a754a8b4a00e50ba80","permalink":"https://robbriers.github.io/publication/beta_ponds/beta_ponds/","publishdate":"2018-01-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/beta_ponds/beta_ponds/","section":"publication","summary":"Purpose: Urbanisation is a leading cause of biotic homogenisation in urban ecosystems. However, there has been little research examining the effect of urbanisation and biotic homogenisation on aquatic communities, and few studies have compared findings across different urban landscapes. We assessed the processes that structure aquatic macroinvertebrate diversity within five UK cities and characterise the heterogeneity of pond macroinvertebrate communities within and among urban areas. Methods: A total of 132 ponds were sampled for invertebrates to characterise biological communities of ponds across five UK cities. Variation among sites within cities, and variation among urban settlements, was partitioned into components of beta diversity relating to turnover and nestedness. Results: We recorded 337 macroinvertebrate taxa, and species turnover almost entirely accounted for the high beta-diversity recorded within each urban area and when all ponds were considered. A total of 40% of all macroinvertebrates recorded were unique to a particular urban settlement. In contrast to the homogenisation of terrestrial and lotic communities in urban landscapes reported in the literature, ponds support highly heterogeneous communities within and among urban settlements. Conclusions: The high species turnover (species replacement) recorded in this study demonstrates that urban pond biodiversity conservation would be most efficient at a landscape-scale, rather than at the individual ponds scale. Pond conservation practices need to consider the spatial organization of ecological communities (landscape-scale) to ensure that the maximum possible biodiversity can be protected.","tags":null,"title":"Community heterogeneity of aquatic macroinvertebrates in urban ponds at a multi-city scale","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Findlay MA","Rob Briers","Diamond N","White PJC"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1511913600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1511913600,"objectID":"be4c2d7901060a75a0d079ec1448658d","permalink":"https://robbriers.github.io/publication/otter_camera/otter_camera/","publishdate":"2017-11-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/otter_camera/otter_camera/","section":"publication","summary":"The study of nocturnal mammals relies on indirect evidence or invasive methods involving capture and tagging of individuals. Indirect methods are prone to error, while capture and tagging mammals have logistical and ethical considerations.

Here, using a 6-year camera-trap study of a Eurasian otter holt (den), we evaluate key parameters of study design. First, we analyse patterns of holt use in relation to researcher visits to maintain the camera traps. Then, using a dual camera-trap deployment, we compare the success of data capture from each camera-trap position in relation to the dual setup. Finally, we provide analyses to optimise minimum survey effort and camera-trap programming. Our findings indicate that otter presence and resting patterns were unaffected by the researcher visits. Results were significantly better using a close camera-trap emplacement than a distant. There was a higher frequency of otter activity at the holt during the natal and early rearing period which has implications for determining the minimum survey duration. Reducing video clip duration from 30 to 19 s would have included 95% of instances where sex could be identified, and saved 35–40% of memory storage. Peaks of otter activity were related to sunrise and sunset; exclusion of diurnal hours would have missed 11% of registrations.

Many studies have focused on the biological response of terrestrial taxa and habitats to urbanization. However, little is known regarding the consequences of urbanization on freshwater habitats, especially small lentic systems. In this study, we examined aquatic macro-invertebrate diversity (family and species level) and variation in community composition between 240 urban and 782 nonurban ponds distributed across the United Kingdom. Contrary to predictions, urban ponds supported similar numbers of invertebrate species and families compared to nonurban ponds. Similar gamma diversity was found between the two groups at both family and species taxonomic levels. The biological communities of urban ponds were markedly different to those of nonurban ponds, and the variability in urban pond community composition was greater than that in nonurban ponds, contrary to previous work showing homogenization of communities in urban areas. Positive spatial autocorrelation was recorded for urban and nonurban ponds at 0-50km (distance between pond study sites) and negative spatial autocorrelation was observed at 100-150km and was stronger in urban ponds in both cases. Ponds do not follow the same ecological patterns as terrestrial and lotic habitats (reduced taxonomic richness) in urban environments; in contrast, they support high taxonomic richness and contribute significantly to regional faunal diversity. Individual cities are complex structural mosaics which evolve over long periods of time and are managed in diverse ways. This facilitates the development of a wide range of environmental conditions and habitat niches in urban ponds which can promote greater heterogeneity between pond communities at larger scales. Ponds provide an opportunity for managers and environmental regulators to conserve and enhance freshwater biodiversity in urbanized landscapes whilst also facilitating key ecosystem services including storm water storage and water treatment.","tags":null,"title":"Urban ponds as an aquatic biodiversity resource in modified landscapes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gress SK","Huxham M","Kairo JG","Mugi LM","Rob Briers"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"3ec462f42b2caba880d66ec2413f5cce","permalink":"https://robbriers.github.io/publication/mangrove_carbon/mangrove_carbon/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/mangrove_carbon/mangrove_carbon/","section":"publication","summary":"Despite covering only approximately 138 000 km(2), mangroves are globally important carbon sinks with carbon density values three to four times that of terrestrial forests. A key challenge in evaluating the carbon benefits from mangrove forest conservation is the lack of rigorous spatially resolved estimates of mangrove sediment carbon stocks; most mangrove carbon is stored belowground. Previous work has focused on detailed estimations of carbon stores over relatively small areas, which has obvious limitations in terms of generality and scope of application. Most studies have focused only on quantifying the top 1 m of belowground carbon (BGC). Carbon stored at depths beyond 1 m, and the effects of mangrove species, location and environmental context on these stores, are poorly studied. This study investigated these variables at two sites (Gazi and Vanga in the south of Kenya) and used the data to produce a country-specific BGC predictive model for Kenya and map BGC store estimates throughout Kenya at spatial scales relevant for climate change research, forest management and REDD+ (reduced emissions from deforestation and degradation). The results revealed that mangrove species was the most reliable predictor of BGC; Rhizophora muronata had the highest mean BGC with 1485.5 t C ha(-1). Applying the species-based predictive model to a base map of species distribution in Kenya for the year 2010 with a 2.5 m(2) resolution produced an estimate of 69.41 Mt C [+/- 9.15 95% confidence interval (C.I.)] for BGC in Kenyan mangroves. When applied to a 1992 mangrove distribution map, the BGC estimate was 75.65 Mt C (+/- 12.21 95% C.I.), an 8.3% loss in BGC stores between 1992 and 2010 in Kenya. The country-level mangrove map provides a valuable tool for assessing carbon stocks and visualizing the distribution of BGC. Estimates at the 2.5 m(2) resolution provide sufficient details for highlighting and prioritizing areas for mangrove conservation and restoration.","tags":null,"title":"Evaluating, predicting and mapping belowground carbon stores in Kenyan mangroves","type":"publication"},{"authors":["White S","Rob Briers","Bouyer Y","Odden J","Linnell JDC"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1443657600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1443657600,"objectID":"40183e80385c433ce7defed3afc36d54","permalink":"https://robbriers.github.io/publication/lynx_dens/lynx_dens/","publishdate":"2015-10-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/lynx_dens/lynx_dens/","section":"publication","summary":"In carnivores, securing suitable den sites with associated early maternal home ranges is important for successful reproduction, and understanding natal den site selection is essential to ensure that these habitats are protected from human disturbance.

Habitat destruction and degradation persist despite long-standing recognition of the important ecological functions of mangroves. Hence new approaches are needed to help stakeholders and policy-makers achieve sound management that is informed by the best science. Here we explore how the new policy concept of Climate Compatible Development (CCD) can be applied to achieve better outcomes. We use economic valuation approaches to combine socio-economic data, projections of forest cover based on quantitative risk mapping and storyline scenario building exercises to articulate the economic consequences of plausible alternative future scenarios for the mangrove forests of the South Kenya coast, as a case study of relevance to many other areas. Using data from 645 household surveys, 10 focus groups and 74 interviews conducted across four mangrove sites, and combining these with information on fish catches taken at three landing sites, a mangrove carbon trading project and published data allowed us to make a thorough (although still partial) economic valuation of the forests. This gave a current value of the South Coast mangroves of USD 6.5 million, or USD 1166 ha(-1), with 59% of this value on average derived from regulating services. Quantitative risk mapping, projecting recent trends over the next twenty years, suggests a 43% loss of forest cover over that time with 100% loss at the most vulnerable sites. Much of the forest lost between 1992 and 2012 has not been replaced by high value alternative land uses hence restoration of these areas is feasible and may not involve large opportunity costs. We invited thirty eight stakeholders to develop plausible storyline scenarios reflecting Business as Usual (BAU) and CCD which emphasises sustainable forest conservation and management in twenty years time, drawing on local and regional expert knowledge of relevant policy, social trends and cultures. Combining these scenarios with the quantitative projections and economic baseline allowed the modelling of likely value added and costs avoided under the CCD scenario. This suggests a net present value of more than US$20 million of adoption of CCD rather than BAU. This work adds to the economic evidence for mangrove conservation and helps to underline the importance of new real and emerging markets, such as for REDD + projects, in making this case for carbon-rich coastal habitats. It demonstrates a policy tool CCD that can be used to engage stakeholders and help to co-ordinate policy across different sectors towards mangrove conservation.","tags":null,"title":"Applying Climate Compatible Development and economic valuation to coastal management: A case study of Kenya's mangrove forests","type":"publication"},{"authors":["McWhinnie L","Rob Briers","Fernandes TF"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420070400,"objectID":"b140dccab5e71fd7fdc490dd41c5f6e0","permalink":"https://robbriers.github.io/publication/zoning_scheme/","publishdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/zoning_scheme/","section":"publication","summary":"Marine Spatial Planning attempts to develop integrated planning frameworks for the management of activities within marine ecosystems and support sustainable development.

Population density, soil type and proximity to roads were the most important predictors. In order to validate this model it was used to generate a map of losses of Kenyan mangroves predicted to have occurred between 2000 and 2010. The qualitative categorical model was constructed using data from the same selection of variables, with the coincidence of different risk factors in particular mangrove areas used in an additive manner to create a relative risk index which was then mapped. Quantitative predictions of loss were significantly correlated with the actual loss of mangroves between 2000 and 2010 and the categorical risk index values were also highly correlated with the quantitative predictions. Hence, in this case the relatively simple categorical modelling approach was of similar predictive value to the more complex quantitative model of mangrove deforestation. The advantages and disadvantages of each approach are discussed, and the implications for mangroves are outlined.","tags":null,"title":"Making predictions of mangrove deforestation: a comparison of two methods in Kenya","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kirui KB","Kairo JG","Bosire J","Viergever KM","Rudra S","Huxham MH","Rob Briers"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1380585600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1380585600,"objectID":"9fad6ae9cf82801acd2af5e431428f6e","permalink":"https://robbriers.github.io/publication/mangrove_change/mangrove_change/","publishdate":"2013-10-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/mangrove_change/mangrove_change/","section":"publication","summary":"Mangroves in Kenya provide a wide range of valuable services to coastal communities despite their relatively small total area. Studies at single sites show reductions in extent and quality caused by extraction for fuel wood and timber and clearance for alternative land use including saltpans, aquaculture, and tourism. Such studies suggest that Kenyan mangroves are likely to conform to the general global trend of declining area but there are no reliable recent estimates of either total mangrove extent or trends in coverage for the country. The total extent of Kenyan mangroves was estimated at four points in time (1985, 1992, 2000 and 2010) using Landsat satellite imagery. Due to its medium resolution, Landsat may underestimate mangrove areas in Kenya where relatively small, linear, coastal features occur. There is also a high frequency of clouds in the coastal areas which can cause data gaps during analysis. However comparison with aerial photographs taken in 1992 showed satisfactory levels of accuracy (87.5%) and Cohen's Kappa (0.54) validating its use in this context. These 1992 data provided an independently validated baseline from which to detect changes (fore- and hind-casted) in other periods after removing cloud coverage. We estimated total mangrove coverage in 2010 at 45,590 ha representing a loss of 18% (0.7% yr(-1)) in the 25 years between 1985 and 2010. Rates of mangrove loss for Kenya varied both spatially and temporally with variations possibly due to legislative inadequacies and differences in habitat alteration patterns. Hence freely available Landsat images proved adequate to detect changes in mangroves and revealed that Kenya shows rates of decline similar to (although slower than) global estimates.","tags":null,"title":"Mapping of mangrove forest land cover change along the Kenya coastline using Landsat imagery","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rob Briers","Waterman JO","Galt K","Campbell RNB"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1356998400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1356998400,"objectID":"934ebb728584a16b61eccc9fec799a12","permalink":"https://robbriers.github.io/publication/carotenoids/carotenoids/","publishdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/carotenoids/carotenoids/","section":"publication","summary":"Trout (Salmo trutta) exhibit anadromous and non-anadromous forms which are commonly sympatric.

By 4 months, stable isotope ratios of the two forms were still distinct although both carbon and nitrogen ratios needed to be considered to distinguish the forms. Zeaxanthin levels were more variable and overlapped between the offspring of the two forms. There was significant variation between populations and over time in both isotope ratios and carotenoid composition.

Five thousand one hundred and thirty-seven crabs and 3.6 km of line intercept transect data were collected during a 9-week period. Crab abundance, relative frequency of morphs and substrate type varied significantly among the three sites. Plain crabs were strongly associated with macro-algal substrates whereas patterned crabs were associated with mussel beds. This pronounced phenotype-environment matching, as well as various characteristics of the carapace patterns themselves, suggests that patterned crabs are cryptic on polychromatic backgrounds. The frequency of patterned crabs and the percentage of white pigment on the carapace both declined significantly with carapace width. The loss of pattern coincides with an ontogenetic shift in habitat use and we present evidence to suggest that individual crabs lose their pigment, rather than larger patterned crabs being preferentially removed from the population by predators.

To overcome this, we use a two-stage procedure where the original sites are aggregated first and an optimum solution is determined for the aggregate sites.

This study provides evidence for niche-based explanations of range size variation, and suggests that both niche breadth and niche availability are important in determining range size.","tags":null,"title":"Range size and environmental calcium requirements of British freshwater gastropods","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Onal H","Rob Briers"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1038700800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1038700800,"objectID":"d2b5602999e596a265feeb2d0ef77d24","permalink":"https://robbriers.github.io/publication/spatial_integer/","publishdate":"2002-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/spatial_integer/","section":"publication","summary":"Considering the spatial location of sites that are to be selected for inclusion in a protected reserve network may be necessary to facilitate dispersal and long-term persistence of species in the selected sites. This paper presents an integer programming JP) approach to the reserve network selection problem where spatial considerations based on intersite distances are taken into account when selecting reserve sites. The objective is to reduce the fragmentation of preserved sites and design a compact reserve network. Two IP formulations are developed which minimize the sum of pairwise distances and the maximum intersite distance between all sites in the reserve network, respectively, while representing all species under consideration. This approach is applied to a pond invertebrate dataset consisting of 131 sites containing 256 species in Oxfordshire, UK. The results show that significant reductions in reserve fragmentation can be achieved, compared with spatially unrestricted optimum reserve selection, at the expense of a small loss in reserve efficiency.","tags":null,"title":"Incorporating spatial criteria in optimum reserve network selection","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rob Briers","Cariss HM","Gee JHR"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1036108800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1036108800,"objectID":"5e9a8dad5f404570204f55792c6ed78e","permalink":"https://robbriers.github.io/publication/dispersal_landuse/dispersal_landuse/","publishdate":"2002-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/dispersal_landuse/dispersal_landuse/","section":"publication","summary":"Populations of benthic invertebrates in neighbouring streams are isolated from each other by intervening terrestrial habitat. The adult stages of stream insects that are capable of flight may disperse between streams, although little is known of the extent of inter-stream dispersal, or the degree to which movement is influenced by riparian vegetation. Double-headed Malaise traps were set at differing distances from the channel to measure the numbers of adult stoneflies moving towards or away from three upland streams draining adjacent catchments on the Plynlimon ridge in mid-Wales. Riparian vegetation differed between the streams: open sheep-grazed moorland, buffer strips left free from 15 year old plantation forestry, and mature conifers planted up to the stream bank. Adult abundance was broadly consistent with benthic larval abundance. In three of the five most abundant species (Amphinemura sulcicollis, Leuctra fusca and Siphonoperla torrentium) abundance varied inversely with the amount of forestry in the riparian zone. In the others (L. inermis and L nigra) numbers caught were unrelated to forestry. Relationships between adult abundance and distance from the channel were best described by inverse power functions. Numbers of adults declined sharply with distance from the stream; 90 % of adults were caught within I I in of the stream channel. The rate of decline of adult numbers with distance did not differ with riparian vegetation. Inter-stream differences in the numbers caught at particular distances were due to differences in overall abundance. There were no differences in the number of males or females caught at different distances from the stream. At all times more stoneflies were caught in the side of the trap facing the stream than that facing away, although the difference was greatest in the middle of the flight period and least at the beginning and end. Overall, the majority of adult stoneflies did not disperse a significant distance from the stream channel, suggesting that only a very limited number of individuals are likely to disperse between streams.","tags":null,"title":"Dispersal of adult stoneflies (Plecoptera) from upland streams draining catchments with contrasting land-use","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rob Briers"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1009843200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1009843200,"objectID":"8d34ee852f77491b556161cbcf451174","permalink":"https://robbriers.github.io/publication/connectivity/connectivity/","publishdate":"2002-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/connectivity/connectivity/","section":"publication","summary":"Methods for selecting sites to be included in reserve networks generally neglect the spatial location of sites, often resulting in highly fragmented networks. This restricts the possibility of dispersal between sites, which for many species may be essential for long-term persistence. Here I describe iterative reserve selection algorithms which incorporate considerations of reserve connectivity and evaluate their performance using a data set for macroinvertebrates in ponds. Methods where spatial criteria were only invoked when ties between sites occurred did not perform significantly better than a simple greedy algorithm in terms of reserve connectivity. An algorithm based on a composite measure of species added and changes in reserve connectivity produced a reserve network with higher connectivity, but needed more sites to represent all species. A trade-off between connectivity and efficiency may be inevitable. but the costs in terms of efficiency may be justified if long-term persistence of species is more likely.","tags":null,"title":"Incorporating connectivity into reserve selection procedures","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rob Briers","Warren PH"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":957139200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":957139200,"objectID":"2878d0f1a1d5bf2e7d93b1e98d429051","permalink":"https://robbriers.github.io/publication/metapop/metapop/","publishdate":"2000-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/metapop/metapop/","section":"publication","summary":"Simple metapopulation models assume that local populations occur in patches of uniform quality habitat separated by non-habitat. However field metapopulations tend to show considerable spatial and temporal variation in patch quality, and hence probability of occupancy. This may have implications for the adequacy of simple metapopulation models in describing and predicting regional population dynamics of natural systems. This study investigated the effects of habitat characteristics on landscape-scale occupancy dynamics of two species of backswimmer (Notonecta Hemiptera: Notonectidae) in small freshwater ponds. The results demonstrated clear links between habitat, pond occupancy and population turnover, particularly local extinction. There were considerable changes in the habitat of individual ponds between years, but local changes were not spatially correlated and the frequency distribution of habitat conditions at the landscape level remained similar in different years. Stable occupancy levels of Notonecta species appears to result from a balance of the rates of creation and loss of suitable habitat due to spatially uncorrelated habitat change. Systems such as this, where turnover is driven by habitat dynamics, demonstrate the potential value of incorporating the dynamics of habitat change into metapopulation models. Such developments are Likely to improve predictions of landscape-scale occupancy dynamics, whilst also allowing patch-level predictions of occupancy, based on local habitat conditions.","tags":null,"title":"Population turnover and habitat dynamics in Notonecta (Hemiptera: Notonectidae) metapopulations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rob Briers","Warren PH"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":933465600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":933465600,"objectID":"74c40119b077429dad878be19f15e7d9","permalink":"https://robbriers.github.io/publication/noto_comp/noto_comp/","publishdate":"1999-08-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/noto_comp/noto_comp/","section":"publication","summary":"1. Two species of freshwater invertebrate predator, Notonecta maculata and N. obliqua, showed a negative association in a series of small, man-made ponds in the Peak National Park, Derbyshire, U.K. The present study examines the potential role of interspecific interactions among nymphs on this regional distribution pattern. 2. The survival, development and feeding efficiency of nymphs were examined in laboratory and field mesocosm experiments with intra- and interspecific competition and contrasting environmental complexity. 3. Survival to adulthood and mean lifespan varied significantly in interspecific competition treatments in both laboratory and field experiments, with N. maculata showing higher survival in the simple environment and N. obliqua higher survival in the complex environment. 4. Variations in feeding efficiency were consistent with the survival trends: N. maculata had a higher efficiency in the simple environment, whereas N. obliqua had greater efficiency in the complex environment. There was evidence of a developmental response in feeding efficiency, with differences between species increasing with age. 5. These results suggest that the relative competitive abilities of the two species are affected by habitat complexity, and that competition between species may modify the species distribution where they co-occur.","tags":null,"title":"Competition between the nymphs of two regionally co-occurring species of Notonecta (Hemiptera : Notonectidae)","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"R packages I am the creator and maintainer of the following packages:\nbiotic.
